# TFforge
TFforge is a method that collectively considers a set of regulatory elements and quantifies transcription factor (TF) 
binding site differences per branch in the phylogeny to infer those TFs that are important for phenotypic differences 
between the considered species. 
TFforge corrects for phylogenetic dependencies between species, does not require thresholds for TF 
binding site determination and is not sensitive to binding site turnover.
